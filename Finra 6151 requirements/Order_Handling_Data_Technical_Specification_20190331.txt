This specification does not provide interpretative guidance for any rule.  1.2 Definitions Customer Reports: The Held/Exempt Not-Held Order Routing Customer Report and Not-Held Order Handling Customer Report. Order Handling Reports:  Collectively, the Held Order Routing Public Report, the Held/Exempt NotHeld Order Routing Customer Report, and the Not-Held Order Handling Customer Report. Held Order Routing Public Report:  The quarterly report required by Rule 606(a), in XML format. Held/Exempt Not-Held Order Routing Customer Report:  The report required by Rule 606(b)(1), in XML format. Not-Held Order Handling Customer Report:  The report required by Rule 606(b)(3), in XML format. XML Schema: A World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommendation that specifies how to formally describe the elements in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. This description can be used to verify that each item of content in a document adheres to the description of the element in which the content is to be placed. Schema for Order Handling Reports:  The most recent XML 1.0 Schema posted on the SEC web site. Valid File:  An XML file representing any one of the three order reports that is valid with respect to the Schema for Order Handling Reports.  One file contains the data for all months covered by a given report. Report Renderer:  The most recent JavaScript program to validate a file and transform the Valid File to PDF; this JavaScript program may be executed in any convenient JavaScript processor, and in particular, the program can run from a web page where any user may select a file for their browser to privately check its validity and perform the transformation. PDF File:  A PDF formatted file as produced by the Report Renderer. 1.3 Dissemination The broker-dealer shall disseminate reports to customers upon request and to the public each quarter as both Valid Files and PDF Files.  1.3.1 Held Order Routing Public Report Broker-dealers shall display the Held Order Routing Public Report on their web site at a permanent URL that is readily accessible.  The URL shall provide the following links, also readily accessible: 1) Permanent links to the most current quarterly Held Order Routing Public Report: a) A Valid File covering the three months of that quarter’s data; b) A PDF File as produced by the Report Renderer processing the Valid File; c) The same data in any other formats at the broker-dealer’s option. 2) Permanent links to three years’ worth of reports (that is, up to 11 additional sets of links):1 a) Each Valid File (valid as of its original date of posting); b) Each PDF file as produced by the Report Renderer (as of its original date of posting); c) The same data in any other formats at the broker-dealer’s option. 1.3.2 Customer Reports Broker-dealers shall disclose to its customer on request: 1) To Customers placing orders covered by the Customer Reports: a) If applicable, a Valid Report that is a Held/Exempt Not-Held Order Routing Customer Report for data covering the preceding six months of activity; b) If applicable, a Valid Report that is a Not-Held Order Handling Customer Report for data covering the preceding six months of activity; c) PDF Files as produced by the Report Renderer processing any Valid Reports disclosed; d) The same data in any other formats at the broker-dealer’s option. 1.4 Concept Definition Tables The headers of a concept definition table are as follows: Ref. provides the citation to the relevant section within 17 CFR 242.606. Concept is the brief title for the data element. D denotes the depth of nesting within the XML report that the element occurs.  # denotes the number of occurrences allowed for a given element.  “1” indicates the element is required; “1..n” indicates that at least 1 and at least n occurrences are allowed, with “*” indicating an unlimited number of occurrences. Element is the abbreviation used in the schema and in schema-valid instance files.  For example, “Shares Routed” is a concept, while routed is the element name.   Definition:  When the concept is defined in the rule that definition is provided here.  Simple elements may be described as numbers, text, time stamps, etc., but some elements are composed of other elements.   1.5 Abbreviations Used Within Element Names Elements that are numeric amounts have a suffix in its name to indicate the unit of measure and the valid range of values, e.g., orderPct.  The suffixes used in the schema are as follows: • Shr: Shares, 0 or more. • Ord: Orders, 0 or more. • Pct: A percentage value between 0 and 100 inclusive, to two decimal places.  Example: “99.44” means 99.44%.  Where a percentage is not meaningful because its denominator would be zero, use the empty text string “”. • Cph: Cents per Hundred shares, positive or negative, to four decimal places.  Example: “1.5000” means one and a half cents per hundred shares. • Usd: US Dollars, positive or negative. • Msec: Milliseconds, 0 or more, rounded to the nearest whole number.  Example:  21.5 milliseconds is reported as “22” meaning 22 milliseconds, that is, 0.022 seconds. • netPmtPaidRecv: Amounts received by the broker-deal (positive), less any amounts paid by the broker-dealer. 1.6 Reporting Data for Months in which there is no Activity Monthly data for a venue or customer for which no orders were routed or executed shall be represented in the report the following way: Year and month: Provide the year and month even when there was no activity. Elements measured in USD, Shares, or Orders: Use only the value 0. Elements measured in Pct, Cph, or Msec, or Flags: Do not omit the element; use only an empty element (for example, <ndoMarketPct/>).  Values such as N/A or NA are invalid.   1.7 Validation XML Schema validation will signal errors such as missing or misplaced elements, negative values where a positive value is required, values outside the expected range, and insufficient decimal digits of precision.  XML Schema validation will also signal errors such as when a list of months contains repeated months.   2 HELD ORDER ROUTING PUBLIC REPORT DEFINITIONS The held order routing public report is disclosed to the public each calendar quarter and is broken down by calendar month.

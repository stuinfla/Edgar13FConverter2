1. Introduction The FINRA Rule 6151 Order Routing Information Filing document provides a guide for member firms who are required to submit to FINRA for centralized publication the order routing reports required under the Securities and Exchange Commission’s SEC Rule 606(a).  To upload Rule 606(a) Reports, member firms will need to complete the entitlement process for accessing FINRA’s systems (refer to Section 2 for more information). Once processed, firms may upload documents through the FINRA Gateway user interface (refer to Section 6 for more information) or via a direct machine-to-machine file transfer (refer to Section 5 for more information). Once the reports are submitted, firms will be notified of the file upload status (refer to Section 7 for more information). For information on FINRA Rule 6151 and additional requirements visit FINRA Communication Hub. Rule 606(a) reports submitted to FINRA will be published in the FINRA Data Portal. 
2. FINRA Entitlement Program  FINRA Entitlement Program is the process by which firms are granted secure access to participating FINRA web applications.  A firm will require a FINRA Entitlement account and a designated Super Account Administrator (SAA) to submit Rule 606(a) reports using FINRA’s systems.  For FINRA Gateway, refer to the SAA link above on how to get entitlements/account access. In the case of machine-to-machine file uploads (using fileX), the firm is required to reach out to the FINRA support group (or via telephone at (800) 321-6273 ) to create/modify user accounts as well as grant entitlements. For SAA and machine-to-machine access, firms must:  - Complete the FINRA Entitlement Agreement (FEA)  - Complete the New Organization SAA Form   Once FINRA approves access, the organization’s SAA will receive entitlements, which they can grant to other users in the organization, or a machine account will be created by the FINRA Entitlement team.   The entitlement details are as follows: - Entitlement: SEC Rule 606 NMS Reporting - Entitlement description: Will allow approved users to upload Rule 606(a) reports through fileX or via the UI in FINRA Gateway For support, please refer Section 8   3. File Upload Specifications: Introducing Firm Clearing Firm Relationship  The following section contains reporting requirements for member introducing firms that, pursuant to existing SEC guidance, route all their customer orders to one or more clearing firms for further routing and execution and adopt such clearing firm’s Rule 606(a) reports by reference.   These member introducing firms are required to (i) submit to FINRA a comma separated values (CSV) file that lists its clearing firm(s) along with a web link to a webpage where the member introducing firm discloses its clearing firm relationship(s) and adopts the clearing firm’s reports by reference and (ii) update the submission if the information previously provided changes. Please note, this CSV is a one-time submission, only requiring subsequent file submission in case a member introducing firm needs to update the information previously provided to FINRA.   This CSV file submission will be subject to the same publication requirement as Rule 606(a) report submissions, i.e., the CSV file must be submitted within one month after the end of the calendar quarter addressed in the report.  While the clearing firms will have to submit Rule 606(a) reports to FINRA, the introducing firms are responsible for ensuring proper and timely submission of said reports.  The clearing firm relationship CSV file must contain the following details: - 	CSV file name format o Intro firm crd number_606_NMS_ clearing_Firm_Details.csv              ? 	Sample file name: 12345_606_NMS_clearing_Firm_Details.csv - 	CSV Required fields. o clearing Firm CRD o Weblink to the intro firm clearing firm relationship.  Sample Clearing Firm relationship CSV contents:  4567,https://firm123.com/disclaimer-link 1634,https://firm123.com/disclaimer-link 9367,https://firm123.com/disclaimer-link     4. File Upload Specifications: 606 Reports Uploads must consist of Rule 606(a) reports in two formats: PDF and XML. If a member firm submits a subsequent Rule 606(a) report for the same reporting period, the subsequent Rule 606(a) report will replace the previously submitted Rule 606(a) report.  A user should use the following naming template for a Rule 606(a) Report file that will be uploaded to FINRA.org:  - firm CRD number_606_NMS_YYYY_Qn.PDF - firm CRD number_606_NMS_YYYY_Qn.XML Refer Order Routing & Handling Schema Tech Spec for technical specifications on Rule 606(a) PDF, XML reporting requirements  The following information is required on the Rule 606(a) report for both PDF and XML formats: - Firm CRD number for whom the report data applies. - Quarter + year (YYYY_Qx) for which the report data applies. - An optional suffix (_<suffix>) if desired - Mention of ‘606’ to identify files as being 606 reports. - Include NMS to identify 606 NMS reports. - An optional suffix can be added after the quarter.  	Sample file names: 	 - 12345_606_NMS_2024_Q1.PDF - 12345_606_NMS_2024_Q1.XML - 4567_606_NMS_2023_Q4_20240108.XML  Note: For information about what rules/restrictions apply to the filename, refer to section 7, FAQ 5 of the fileX User Guide.   5. File Transfer via Machine-to-Machine For IP whitelisting and other instructions/information on machine-to-machine transfers using fileX, refer to the fileX User Guide. For the list of validations performed on Rule 606(a) Reports, error codes, and feedback files on successful/failed file upload, refer to section 7.
